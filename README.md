# The Nightmare Depot

The Nightmare Depot is a website designed to provide a resource for aspiring wrestlers to use in order to secure training and booking. Wrestling as an industry has historically been very difficult to enter. This has changed over the past few decades, though charlatans are notorious in the lower ends of the industy.

The aim of The Nightmare Depot is to facilitate contact between prospects and established trainers/promotions. By doing so in a professional manner, The Nightmare Depot hopes to overcome several issues that affect young talent in the industry, such as financial abuse and "trainers" disappearing without notice.

The long term goal of such an endeavour is to support and grow the wrestling industry in Ireland, which has suffered since its inception under illegitimate promoters, low public engagement and the opportunities available abroad enticing talent away. The Ngithmare Depot hopes to provide a pathway to these opportunites for young talent while also fostering a self-reliant system of mutually beneficial promotion across Munster and, once established, Ireland as a whole.

# Wireframes
A decision was made early in the development process to use hand-drawn wireframes in hopes of remaining flexible with finalised designs. Throughout development it became clear that the use of a wireframing application such as balamiq would have been of great benefit to the website. It is with regret that such an application was not used and future developments will make use of such applications to ease the process.

Provided below are photographs of the hand-drawn wireframes which differ in several places from the finalised product.

## Colour Palette
A very basic colour palette was decided upon following research into the independant wrestling scene. These promotions tend to be influenced by musical genres such as punk and metal. Three basic and bold colours which proliferate these scenes were selected in order to emulate and honour the aesthetic.

# Proposed Future Implementations
Deadlines resulted in several features being earmarked for future implementations. Some examples will be provided below.

## Location Page
A page dedicated to providing users with an interactive map displaying the operational locations across Munster. This section would ideally provide drop down menus for each location, allowing users to easily access further information such as opening times and eircodes.

## Tutorial Page
A page featuring several entry-level videos of training across all disciplines. The intention of this section would be to give users an idea of what to expect should they join The Nightmare Depot, as well showcasing the facilities and skilled trainers on offer to students. Also provided would be private videos available to registered users currently enrolled with The Nightmare Depot.

## Interactive Chat 
A feature which would allow users to contact The Nightmare Depot directly on live chat. This would differ from the sign-up section in that it would not be possible to register interest through this chat. Instead, its purpose would be to provide information to the users regarding prices, requirements and expectations., which typically vary from student to student in the wrestling industry.

## Video and Audio Integration
An autoplay, muted video added to the homepage portraying in-ring action would help excite users upon arrival. Also of benefit would be a section allowing users to listen to snippets of wrestler's entrance music, along with links to relevant spotify pages.

## Roster Gallery
A section detailing all current members of The Nightmare Depot. The only people omitted would be students yet to perform live in front of a crowd. This would allow users to see the legitimate talent involved with the operation. Also provided would be links to the wrestlers personal social media in order to drive user engagement with contracted talent.

# Testing
Testing of the website was performed on several devices across several screen sizes throughout development. Several users were invited to test the site on their own devices and report any issues. These issues were then targeted and fixed where possible.

## Identified Issues
The following issues were identified and will be adressed in a future build of the site.

### Sign-up Styling issues
The intention was to have the sign up form centred and more prominent on desktop, much as it is on mobile. The issue was identified late in devlopment and could not be fixed prior to deadline.

### Hero Image on Mobile
The Homepage splash image is cropped on mobile, showing the dropkick itself without the contextual imagery of the two wrestlers. Identified as an issue that muddled the intention of the site on first arrival, it unfortunately caused css issues that could not be addressed before deadline.

### Gallery
An issue was identified where the gallery appeared in one column on certain phone models. Other models of similar size displayed two columns. The issue could not be fixed prior to deadline.

### White Bar Issue
An issue was identified by some testers on their browsers where a white bar appears at the end of the page. Unfortunately the source of the issue could not be identified.

## Validator Testing
The HTML was tested on the official W3C Validator and showed no errors.
The CSS was tested on the official Jigsaw Validator and showed no errors.

### Lighthouse
Each page on both mobile and desktop was subjected to a Lighthouse tests. All but one performed in the green across the board. The testing performed on the testimonial is sampled below. It is typical of the other pages.

![Lighthouse](assets/readme-images/lighthouse.jpg)

The mobile testing on the gallery section returned an orange rating in performance. Lighthouse identified a large layout shift as the main cotributor to the problem, along with some other minor issues. Below is the test results.

# Deployment
Through github I went into settings and then selected pages from the menu on the left. After selecting source I chose to deploy from a branch. Under branch I set it to main-root and saved. This deployed the page and provided a link which was used throughout the development process to live test the website.

That deployment is available here: (https://adamfcode.github.io/nightmare-depot/index.html)
